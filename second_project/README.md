# World COVD-19 Information

## MVP GOALS

I will be using the COVID-19 API (https://covid19api.com/) to create an app that provides information on COVID-19 cases by Country. The initial page(homepage) will have a complete alphabetical listing of world countries. A user will then, be able to click on the country of interest and information about the COVID-19 cases will display on a separate page. The goal of this app is to keep users informed, during this unsettling time.

For the final MVP goal, I will utilize StoryBook to create 5 reusable components.

**COMPONENT HEIRARCHY**

- APP
  - HEADER
  - HOME
    - COUNTRY
      - DETAILED INFO
  - FOOTER

## Post MVP GOALS

I'd like to integreate the CDC API (https://open.cdc.gov/apis.html) to provide more detailed information on COVID-19.
