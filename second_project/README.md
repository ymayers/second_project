# World COVD-19 Information

#### MVP GOALS

I am creating an app that provides the total number of COVID-19 cases per Country. There will be homepage listing all of the countries. A user will be able to click on the country of inquiry and information about the COVID-19 cases will display on a separate page. The goal of this app is to keep users well informed, during this pandemic.

I will be using the COVID-19 API (https://covid19api.com/).

**COMPONENT HEIRARCHY**

- APP
  - HEADER

#### Post MVP GOALS

I'd like to integreate the CDC API (https://open.cdc.gov/apis.html) to incorporate more detailed information on COVID-19.
